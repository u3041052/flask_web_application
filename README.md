# flask_web_application
This repository will give you a brief overview about flask web application.

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python Flask project. In this sample, we use flask to build a web application and the pytest to run tests.

## Steps to do this properly:-
1. First, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can install Flask using **pip**.
```
pip install Flask
```
2. Create a Project Directory: Create a directory for your Flask project and navigate into it.
```
mkdir my_flask_app
cd my_flask_app
```

3. **Set up the Project structure**: Inside the project directory, create the following files:
-  > app.py (main application file)
-  > templates/ (directory for HTML templates)
-  > static/ (directory for static files like CSS and JavaScript)

4. **Create the Flask Application**

5.  > Run the Application
**Start the Flask Development Server**: Run the Flask development server by executing the following command in your project directory:
  ```
   python app.py
  ```
6. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to > http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
