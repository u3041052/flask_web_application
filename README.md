# flask_web_application
This repository will give you a brief overview about flask web application.

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python Flask project. In this sample, we use flask to build a web application and the pytest to run tests.

## Steps to do this properly:-
1. First, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can install Flask using **pip**.
```
pip install Flask
```

```
mkdir my_flask_app
cd my_flask_app
``
3. Set up the Project structure: Inside the project directory, create the following files:
- > app.py (main application file)
